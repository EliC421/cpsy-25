# IDEAS FOR DIRECTONS

## AFTER READING THE ML PAPER
-------------------------------

>>ML
- potentially use AE/VAE to compress multimodal into singular latent space, measure reconstruction loss.
- paper used handy things like monotonic variables, laplacian regularization, transparency, and performance.
    - main things to keep are -> monotonic, transparency, performance


>>DIRECT
- ML background measuring multimodal compression
- Returns a CI > threshold: continue
- Return singular metric and area specific details
- provide in innocent metaphor with further details available
- allow AI communication about results *<- cherry on top*
